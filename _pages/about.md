Hi, I'm Serhan from Istanbul, Turkey. I'm a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University. With huge interest in data analysis and visualization I've ended up creating this blog. Here, in this blog I want to ask and answer interesting questions (monologues?:) and share interesting studies. Most of the questions will not come with analyze-ready data so I'll dig into web, get the data, try to clean it as much as possible. The explorations will also include Kaggle competitions, or implementation of an study in the literature to another area of interest. I think this is going to be an intermediate to advanced data science blog, and serve as a guide for anyone doing more with data using Python, R, Julia and Scala.
